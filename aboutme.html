            <h2>YAMAHA FZ150i</h2>
            <p>I have always longed for a motorbike, and the first one that I could get my hands on was FZ150i. Yes, it was a great companion, to say the least, for every road you could have on your mind. For all of my needs, this 150cc motorcycle couldn’t perform any better. I’d had the most memorable experiences, those that I hardly forget, with this amazing machine. The FZ150i is stable, reliable and most of all, comfortable, at least, to me it is.</p>
            <p>Though I no longer have it with me, never will I forget the rides I had with my beloved FZ. All the turns and corners I made with it shall forever be right here, in the depth of my heart.</p>

            <h2>HONDA CBR150R</h2>
            <p>The one-of-a-kind colorway and its retro design. Those were what struck me when I first got my eyes on the CBR150R. To me, This bike is certainly one of the best looking in the 150cc sport bike segment. And, much to my astonishment, I currently have this bike in my possession!</p>
            <p>After roughly 4 months of owning the bike, I can say that it is quite stable, which is comparable to the FZ150i. Perhaps, one downside of this small sport bike is that its power-to-weight ratio is not that impressive. The CBR150R has a kerb weight of about 145 kg – quite a number for a 150cc machine with roughly 17 hp. Anyway, considering its look and uniqueness, it is still a great bike.</p>

            <h2>KAWASAKI NINJA 300</h2>
            <p>Ninja. A production line of well-known sport bikes from Kawasaki – an infamous motorcycle manufacturers. Such is unknown to me when I was a 18-year-old-boy.</p>
            <p>Without knowing, I developed an interest in motorcycles at the age of youth and fell in love with Ninja. Yes, as I said before, I have always longed for a motorbike, a Ninja to be precise. I don’t know why I started to dream of it, but it was probably because of how popular Kawasaki was. Owning one and riding on it might just be a dream for me, at least for now. But one day, I wish to make it come true. I will.</p>
