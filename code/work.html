    <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p>I am working for a media company in Vietnam. And as I said, I’m currently a subber – one who makes subtitles for films and TV shows. My job is not that of a boring, non-sentimental thing, but it can sometimes be a truly mood downer.
            One typical working day in the life of a subber like me will start with reading news on the internet. Yup, I will start the day reviewing what is happening around me. Then, I begin doing my subtitles, which are mainly for the YouTube videos of my boss. The content I need to translate is somewhat bullshit, but most of the time, they could be worse. Well, despite saying that, I have to admit there are pretty meaningful shows – those that keep me working.

        <p>I am trying to expand and develop my career. Being in the comfortable zone is somewhat relaxing, but it is not a place to be. I know that I have to make a move quickly before I miss my chances. Fighting!</p>
