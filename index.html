                    <p>My name is Tim Fung, just a guy who loves bikes and riding in the feels. Sometimes, I can be very considerate toward others, helping those who need help. Yet, there is still an ass inside of me trying to find his way out, most of the time :D.</p>

                    <p>I’m currently a subber – one who makes subtitles for films and TV shows. My job is not that of a boring, non-sentimental thing, but it can sometimes be a truly mood downer. (Well, we can talk more about that in the ‘About my work’ section.</p>

                    <p>As a young man, 28 years of age atm, I am still trying to find my way in this life. Yup, the kind of person who aims for a ride of feels and make a great deal out of it. This is the reason why I am writing this portfolio – let's call it that – to clear my doubts.</p>

               <h2>My ideal in this fucking life</h2>
               <p>As crazy as it literally is, this life is an opportunity for everyone, to feel bliss or to be in pain. That all depends on how each of us perceive our respective situation, I believe. Since we were born with a different and distinct situation, I bet the best we can do is to find our own little piece of joy – something that is hidden in a corner somewhere of our lives – and fucking enjoy it. Simple as that.</p>

                <h2>The goal I am striving for</h2>
                <p> I have nothing but one goal in this life. That is to make me and my loved ones happy. What else should one be worrying about? Isn’t the purpose of one’s life simple as that? I don’t know myself. One thing is for sure. I know that I have to do my best and give it my everything while I still can. Time waits for no one, and I hope that I still have plenty of it to pursuit my happy ending.</p>
